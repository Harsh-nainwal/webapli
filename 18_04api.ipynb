    "Q1.What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "   An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. An example of API usage in real life is when you use a weather app on your smartphone. The weather app uses an API provided by a weather data service to fetch current weather information for your location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "   Advantages of using APIs:\n",
    "   Interoperability: APIs enable different software systems to communicate and work together, promoting interoperability.\n",
    "   Efficiency: APIs allow developers to leverage functionalities of existing systems without needing to reinvent the wheel, saving time and effort.\n",
    "   Scalability: APIs facilitate scaling of services by allowing them to be accessed by multiple clients simultaneously.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Disadvantages of using APIs:\n",
    " Dependency: If an API that your application relies on changes or becomes unavailable, it can disrupt your application's functionality.\n",
    "   Security risks: Improperly secured APIs can be vulnerable to attacks, leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.\n",
    "   Overhead: Implementing and maintaining APIs requires resources, including development time and server resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.**\n",
    "   A Web API is an API specifically designed to be accessed over the internet using the HTTP protocol. While all Web APIs are APIs, not all APIs are Web APIs. APIs can be implemented for various purposes, including accessing hardware features, database operations, or internal functions of a software system, whereas Web APIs are typically used for accessing web-based services and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "   REST (Representational State Transfer): REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all necessary information to process the request.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):** SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It uses XML for message formatting and relies on other protocols like HTTP or SMTP for message transmission. SOAP APIs are more rigid and require a predefined contract (WSDL) for communication.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "   - **Complexity:** SOAP messages are typically larger and more complex compared to REST, making them less efficient, especially in bandwidth-constrained environments.\n",
    "   - **Performance:** Due to the XML parsing overhead and additional protocol layers, SOAP can be slower compared to REST.\n",
    "   - **Less flexibility:** SOAP APIs are more tightly coupled, making it harder to evolve and maintain systems compared to RESTful APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Differentiate between REST and SOAP.**\n",
    "   - **Protocol:** REST is an architectural style, while SOAP is a protocol.\n",
    "   - **Message Format:** REST commonly uses lightweight data formats like JSON or XML, while SOAP relies on XML for message formatting.\n",
    "   - **Statefulness:** RESTful APIs are stateless, while SOAP APIs can maintain state between requests.\n",
    "   - **Flexibility:** REST APIs are more flexible and easier to evolve compared to SOAP APIs.\n",
    "   - **Performance:** REST tends to be more lightweight and faster due to simpler message formats and statelessness, whereas SOAP can be slower due to its XML parsing overhead and additional protocol layers."
